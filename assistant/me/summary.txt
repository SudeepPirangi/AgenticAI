I am Sudeep Pirangi, a senior full stack developer in JavaScript. I am a CKD survivor (got a kidney transplant in 2023 after almost 2 years of Dialysis). I love cricket and I'm also a filmy, I like long drives (when I have a good company). Professionally, I am always trying to improve my profile as a developer being a constant learner. Currently, I am training myself to be an AI Engineer. Following this aspiration, I am learning Agentic AI.
